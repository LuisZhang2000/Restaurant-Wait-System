Talia Gokyildirim's Diary 

Week 1

Monday lab: 
- Introductions + assign roles (scrum master, front end, backend etc.)
- Decided on ADDITIONAL 2x weekly standups - Wednesday 9am, Friday 9am  
- Decided on project spec - Wait Management System 
- Set up git, jira, shared google doc
- Brainstorm novel features and email to tute before Sunday

Week 2 

Monday lab: 
- Finalise sprint structure and dates 
- Delegation of user stories and acceptance criteria - we split them up based on the type of user. 
  I wrote the US and AC for Customers. 
- GitHub classroom created. 
- Assigned tasks for group members to finish by Wednesday meeting: 
	Talia: Customer storyboard + research competitors 
	Prathamesh: Wait staff storyboard
	Melody: Manager storyboard
	Lucky: Kitchen staff storyboard + research competitors
	Luis: Proposal background + check/edit backlog user stories & acceptance criteria

Wednesday: 
- Everyone finished their first draft of storyboards on time! Yay! 
- Briefly discussed progress on storyboards although this meeting was primarily focused 
  on splitting the user stories and tasks into the appropriate sprint. 

Friday: 
- Big 2 hour meeting to go through each storyboard/each interface in DEPTH.
  Gave critical feedback to eachother - discussed each design decision, resolved inconsistencies 
  and provided each other with elements and things to be changed. 
  Had to consider the difficulty of implementing different interface design decisions.
  For exammple, I had two columns drawn for the Menu. Long discussion about whether we would like to 
  prioritise UX (to have 2 columns because it looked better visually and would reduce scroll
  and thus improve UX) or whether we should stick to 1 column because it is easier to 
  implement from a technical perspective. Decided to prioritise UX and to work harder to
  implement 2 columns. 
- Over the weekend, our tasks were to implement feedback to the storyboards, 
  for luis/prath to work on the systems architecture and for each of us to add more 
  AC based on the interface design we had decided on. 

Week 3

Monday:
- It was Rosh Hashana (Jewish new year) from Sunday night - Tuesday night which meant that I was unable to attend our 
  tutorial on Monday. I caught up by reading the minutes my team took. 
- backend and front end set up, ready to start coding. On time for sprint 1. 

Wednesday: 
- Cancelled group sync up since decided it was not necessary but Luis helped me 
  set up my system as some things were not working as expected. 

Friday: 
- Going through what we needed to do for Sprint 1 and tidying up the proposal. 
- My role to edit the proposal and tidy the layout. Compare with the sample proposals presented
  in the lecture and also alongside the marking criteria. 

Saturday: 
- Since Prath is more experienced at frontend, he ran a mini tutorial for us. 
  The session was super helpful and we were introduced to React and HTML. I found
  this session to be super interesting since I have always wanted to develop my 
  frontend programming skills. I also know that it will be easier for the team if we 
  are each keen to widen our skillset so that we can help out in a broader range of 
  tasks and therefore complete the project on time and to our full potential. 
- At the end of the session, Lucky, Melody and I went through the proposal and 
  discussed what still needed to be done. I realised that we were missing a couple of 
  things in our draft to what is required by looking carefully at the marking criteria. 
  We were able to split these tasks between us. 
- Re-evaluated our novel features and the scope of their functionality. 
- I took the role of reviewing what everyone had written for the proposal and provide feedback 
  to be implemented. 

Week 4

Monday: 
- Meeting in the morning to finalise the proposal. Everything came together pretty
  easily in the meeting and everyone worked quickly to get it done. Though, we had
  challenges as the storyboards were hard to read and so they needed to be resized and edited. 
  Nonetheless, submitted! 
  
Tues/Wednesday: 
- Tuesday to Wednesday was Yom Kippur. This meant that I could not attend the tutorial, but my team was again 
  understanding of my religious commitments and caught me up after the holiday had ended. 

Throughout the week:
- Now we had to power through Sprint 1. Prath and Luis were able to set up the framework from a frontend perspective.
  This allowed the rest of us to apply the skills we had learnt from Prath's session by starting small. Lucky and I worked 
  on implementing the functionality of the 'Request Assistance' button. We struggled to effectively disable the button, 
  but Prath helped us when we got stuck. Peer programming was effective in this way especially as Lucky and I have just been 
  introduced to frontend/react/html. 
- Lucky and I also wrote the script for the demo. Our team had 3 practice run throughs. 

Week 5: 

Monday: 
- Demo - went really well. Prath and Luis did a great job! It was also really good to hear the tutors feedback as we have spent a long time looking 
  at our work and it is good to get an outside opinion on the UX/UI. 
- Retro - I had prepared a pretty framework on Miro prior to the session so that we could race through the retro after 
  the demo. However, we ended up transferring the content to a google doc so that it was easier to submit. I think the retro was
  an effective process as it was a good time for us to reflect as a group on what operational processes could be better. For example, at one point there
  were 2 of us working on the same card. It was a good time to remind ourselves that our Jira board is the source of truth and if you are working on
  a card, you MUST assign yourself that card! 
  
Saturday: 
- Prath and I worked on Cart Icon number together. This was super hard and Prath led the way as we worked together on a video call. This task involved combining frontend with backend and a lot of debugging. 
  
Throughout the week: 
- Overall, this week I added a badge to menu items that were unavailable and I also disabled the add to cart button for the unavailable items. I also changed the text on the Request assistance button after it has been clicked to tell the user that a waiter is on the way. I have noticed that this button does not remain disabled if you change pages. This is something I will need to fix, but it is not a priority for now. 
- I have also fixed the placement of the Bill button to improve UX as part of our feedback.

Week 6: 

Monday: 
- No class bc of reading week but our group met up regardless to plan for Demo B. 

Wednesday: 
- I added a confirmation modal to delete item button in the Cart screen. I was really proud of myself for completing this on my own. I am 
  definitely feeling a lot more comfortable and confident working with frontend. 
  
Saturday: 
- Today I worked on card 57 and 56. 

Week 7: 
- This week I continued making small, front end changes and also changes to improve the readability of our code. Since adding a My Orders page, the Bill button needed to be used on that page as well as the Cart page. This meant that we could make the Bill button into its own component to avoid reusing code. The other updates I made to our code base included changing the cursors when hovering, and making other important UX changes. This involved using the site a lot and noting down fixes that would improve the UX, and then implementing them. This process is relatively easy with React - which I feel a lot more comfortable with and am really enjoying using. 

Week 8: 
We received full marks for Demo B which was super exciting! I am pretty sick this week and haven't been able to work or sleep.
I planned out the next two weeks - to focus on 1) dynamic price adjustments and 2) tidying up the UI for categories. 


Week 9: 
I set up the scaffold for the final report and delegated tasks between the team as the rest of team were stuck into their cards. 
I struggled to implement (2). We wanted to add a modal that confirms that the user would like to delete a category. This was hard and initially I was getting a lot of errors. Eventually, after peer programming with Prath, we were able to fix the problem I was having by moving the placement of the modals. (1) was implemented and it was quite enjoyable to implement. I had a bug in the version I was completing, and Lucky was able to fix it and use the code. 

Week 10: 
Final presentation! It went really well. I was really nervous about presenting in Demo form but I think it went really well and I felt a lot more comfortable than I expected. The rest of this week has been about focusing on the Report, tidying up the codebase and my birthday :) I feel really relieved that this project is almost over!
